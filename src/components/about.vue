      I am full stack web developer born and raised in San Diego. I enjoy
      building components and learning more and more about modern frameworks. I
      recently graduated a full time bootcamp via UCSD that focused on HTML,
      CSS, Javascript, MYSQL, Nodejs and React. It was a difficult and rewarding
      challenge but it helped me learn how to code in a group setting and
      understand sprint deadlines.
