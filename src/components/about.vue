    I am full stack web developer born and raised in San Diego. I enjoy building
    components and learning more and more about modern frameworks. I recently
    graduated a full time bootcamp via UCSD that focused on HTML, CSS,
    Javascript, MYSQL, Nodejs and React. It was a difficult and rewarding
    challenge but it helped me learn how to code in a group setting and
    understand sprint deadlines.
